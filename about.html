							<p><span>OUR BELIEF</span></p>
															
															<p>We believe there is one GOD, existing eternally in three persons: GOD the father, GOD the son and GOD the Holy Spirit. (John 10:30; Philipians 2:5-7)<br>

We believe GOD is love and HE loves all people.  It is HIS desire to reach out to those who are poor, oppressed, widowed or orphaned, and to heal the broken hearted. (Psalm 68:5,6; John 3:16)<br>

We believe in eternal life, and through belief in JESUS CHRIST as the son of GOD, we spend eternity with the LORD in Heaven. We believe that in rejecting JESUS CHRIST as LORD and Saviour, we receive eternal suffering in hell. (Matthew 25:31-46; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18)</p>	<br>
